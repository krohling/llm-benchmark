A study presents a mechanism by which the hypothesized potential dark-energy-explaining quintessence, if true, would smoothly cause the accelerating expansion of the Universe to inverse to contraction, possibly within the cosmic near-future (100 My) given current data. It concludes that its end-time scenario theory fits "naturally with cyclic cosmologies [(each a theory of cycles of universe originations and ends, rather than the theories of one Big Bang beginning of the Universe/multiverse, to which authors were major contributors)] and recent conjectures about quantum gravity".[19][20][21]

According to reports, the partly-public 2022 United States Congress hearings on UFOs may result in the UAP issue being approached more seriously, such as for a scientific public pursuit for answers and an increased interest from scientists. Known ongoing scientific research is conducted by non-profit groups of researchers that use or develop expensive equipment for new high-quality data[160][161][162] rather than analyzing or systematically organizing public data.
A review concludes that, like in 2015, pollution (¾ from air pollution) was responsible for 9 million premature deaths in 2019 (one in six deaths).

A study shows how a Twin-world models cosmological model – already extensively studied to find out why gravity appears much weaker than other known forces – could explain the Hubble constant (H0) tension via interactions between the two worlds. The "mirror world" would contain copies of all existing fundamental particles.[170][171] On 2 May, another twin/pair-world or "bi-worlds" cosmology is shown to theoretically be able to solve the cosmological constant (Λ) problem, closely related to dark energy: two interacting worlds with a large Λ each resulting in a small shared effective Λ.[172][173][174] Previous similar models e.g. attempt to explain the baryon asymmetry – why there was more matter than antimatter at the beginning – with a mirror anti-universe.[175][176][177]

Early 2022 monkeypox outbreak research:
A study reports phylogenomic characterization of the first monkeypox (MP) virus outbreak genome sequences, finding the "presumably slow-evolving" DNA virus has evolved roughly 6–12-fold more mutations than one would expect and 15 SNP mutations since the beginning of the outbreak.[287][288][289] The WHO announces that MP is not yet a global public health emergency but a cause for deep concern (25 June).[288][290] Early overviews and reviews, including about current knowledge about MP prevention and treatment, are published.[290][291][292][293] Scientists are investigating circulating lineages (and potential variants) of the MP virus and compare them to the African endemic lineages.[290][294][295][296] A preprint suggests that cases "where a small fraction of individuals have disproportionately large numbers of partners, can explain the sustained growth of monkeypox cases among the MSM population" (13 June).[297][298] The MP incubation period is estimated to be 8.5 days on average and up to 21 days (16 June).[290][299] The 3D-folded structures of the whole proteome of the current DNA virus are predicted, which may be useful for the development of (better or updated) vaccines and drugs (28 June).[300] A study indicates MP contaminated surfaces within hospitals and households could be infectious (30 June).[301]
